# Edge Detection

Implementation of the Sobel algorithm to detect edges in images.

This tool allows you to load your own images, view a comparison between the original and processed images, and save the processed image if you like the result.

## Features

- Load your own images
- View side-by-side comparison of the original and processed images
- Save the processed image

## Demo

## How to Use It

1. Download the repository.
2. Launch `Edge_Detection.exe`.
3. Click on the icon next to "Load file".
4. Select an image to perform the edge detection algorithm.
5. View the comparison.
6. If you like the result, you can save the processed image by clicking the icon next to "Save image" and selecting a desired location.

## Possible Issues and Solutions

If you receive an error message stating that the resolution of the selected image is too high, you should resize it first. The console will display the target resolution based on your monitor specifications. You can easily change the resolution online (e.g., [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com)).
